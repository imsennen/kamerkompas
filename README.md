Project for CIP, House of Representatives of the States General during the minor Innovative Data Visualisation.

This project aims to make the work and behavior of Dutch MPs more transparent and accessible through interactive data visualisation and AI-powered exploration tools.
Kamerkompas allows users to navigate parliamentary activity, voting behavior, and speaking time, offering a user-friendly interface supported by intelligent suggestions and summaries.

Built with a focus on clarity, usability, and modern data design, Kamerkompas demonstrates how civic tech and AI can empower citizens and promote political engagement.
